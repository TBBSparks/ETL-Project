# ETL-project
In looking at open data sources on Kaggle, we found data sets for Chicago crime that interested us.  However, we wanted it to be relevant to our community, so we located similar data for our city at https://data.kcmo.org/. We used the crime data by zip code for each year from 2014-current.  The second source of data we originally planned to use was not available at the time we started the project however.  We were able to find Cenus data by zip code at http://zipatlas.com/.  
The following sources for our datasets were used:
